## Design & Usage Guidelines

Use Spinner to indicate the loading of content when the progress is of unknown
length.

### Children

The Spinner component can accept content as children.

<Playground>
  <Spinner>
    <Card title="Lorem Ipsum">
      <Content>
        <Text>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.</Text>
      </Content>
    </Card>
  </Spinner>
</Playground>

### Loading

The Spinner component can optionally toggle loading, which is particularly
useful when also using `children`.

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
    return (
      <>
        <button onClick={() => setLoading(!loading)}>Click me</button>
        <Spinner loading={loading}>
          <Card title="Lorem Ipsum">
            <Content>
              <Text>
                Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
              </Text>
            </Content>
          </Card>
        </Spinner>
      </>
    );
  }}
</Playground>

### Small

The `small` spinner should be used on individual element of an interface (ie.
button or card contents) or when inline with content

<Playground>
  <Spinner size="small" />
</Playground>

### Inline

Use `inline` to render the spinner inline with content, such as when it has a
leading piece of text content that adds context to what loading is happening.

<Playground>
  <Text>
    Uploading... <Spinner size="small" inline={true} />
  </Text>
</Playground>

## Accessibility

The `Spinner` should announce itself to users of assistive technology such as
screenreaders.

The following built-in properties help `Spinner` convey its' role effectively:

- `role="alert"` allows the `Spinner` to be announced as an alert feedback
  element
- `aria-busy={true}` informs the user that the view is busy, setting the
  expectation that they cannot interact for the time being
- `aria-label="loading"` reads out "Loading" to assistive tech, adding context
  as to _why_ the view is busy
- `aria-hidden={true}` hides the loading content if used within the Spinner

the user better context around the process.
